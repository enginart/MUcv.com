## A Demo site for CantoVario

Using react for quick developement, and without a database.

### Mashups
<ul>
<li>All fixed mashups made by Trevor are in the Fixed Folder in src</li>
<li>To see a list of all available mashups, check out fixedlist.json in the Fixed folder</li>
<li>To add/edit mashups, follow the naming conventions laid out in the json for all fields and then add the mp3 file </li>
<li>I think gh-pages might have a 1gb limit for static site hosting, so be careful with that</li>
</ul>

### Styles
All styling is done in the App.css file

### Routing / New Pages
This page uses react-router to control endpoints. Add the route in App and then create your components accoringly!

### Deployment

This site is deployed using [react-gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) module. If any  changes are made, redeploy using command ```npm run deploy```. Changes may take a while to take effect.
